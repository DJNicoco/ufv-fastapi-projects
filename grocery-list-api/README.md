# 🛒 Grocery List API – RESTful CRUD Backend

**Built with FastAPI, Pydantic, and Docker**  
COMP 351 – Advanced Website Programming | UFV | Jan–Apr 2025

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This Grocery List API was developed as a backend project for UFV’s COMP 351 course. I built a file-based RESTful API using FastAPI that allows users to manage grocery items — supporting creation, updates, deletion, filtering, and data validation.

This project was focused on clean backend architecture, input validation with Pydantic, and deploying with Docker.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ **CRUD functionality** – Create, read, update, and delete grocery items  
- ✅ **Pydantic validation** – Enforces correct data types, required fields, and formats  
- ✅ **Search & filtering** – Filter groceries by name, category, or price range  
- ✅ **Data persistence** – All items saved to a local JSON file  
- ✅ **Docker-ready** – Containerized app for consistent deployment  
- ✅ **Custom error handling** – Friendly error messages for invalid input

## 🧪 Sample API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint         | Description                   |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| GET    | `/items`         | Get all grocery items         |
| GET    | `/items/{id}`    | Get a specific item by ID     |
| POST   | `/items`         | Add a new grocery item        |
| PUT    | `/items/{id}`    | Update an existing item       |
| DELETE | `/items/{id}`    | Delete an item by ID          |
| GET    | `/items/search`  | Search/filter items by query  |

## 🛠 Example Input

```json
{
  "name": "Bananas",
  "category": "Fruit",
  "price": 2.49
}
```

All inputs are validated using Pydantic schemas to ensure consistent and secure data structure.

## 📦 Docker Deployment

To build and run the app using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t grocery-api .
docker run -p 8000:8000 grocery-api
```

## 💬 Reflection

This project helped me build confidence in backend development by focusing purely on core API design principles. I learned how to validate input with Pydantic, handle structured error responses, and keep logic clean and testable. 
It was a great stepping stone in learning to ship fast, test endpoints with curl and Postman, and containerize the app with Docker.
